## Overview

A collection of shared data in use at the [Archéosciences Bordeaux](https://www.archeosciences-bordeaux.fr) laboratory (UMR 6034 - CNRS, Université Bordeaux Montaigne, Université de Bordeaux). This package contains data specific to the laboratory instruments (calibration, monitoring, quality control, etc.). These datasets are openly distributed in order to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the results published by the laboratory team.

## Installation

You can install **bdXdata** from [our repository](https://crp2a.r-universe.dev) with:

```{r installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bdXdata", repos = "https://crp2a.r-universe.dev")
```

## Usage

The datasets can be loaded after installing the package:

```{r data, eval=FALSE}
data("BEGe_60cc", package = "bdXdata")
```

The raw data (CSV format) is available in the `data-raw` folder in this repository.
